Introduction:

Healthcare industry is in the phase of rapid change. In particular, the fast-evolving government regulations, technological innovations, and patient expectations create a new environment in which running a medical practice isn’t just about treating patients anymore. The industry is thus actively seeking out solutions for many of the operational challenges through technological advancements like Machine Learning. One of such challenge is predicting patient’s length of stay at the time of admission.
Patient’s Length of Stay (LoS) is a valid indicator to estimate the consumption of hospital resources. Apart from this, LoS estimation also helps manage operational efficiency of the hospital in terms of staff availability (Doctors, nurses and other caretakers alike), resource management (beds, consumables, etc.), hygiene compliance, individual patient workflow and managing the inflow of patients based on available resources. 

Such efficiency in operation becomes imperative in current scenario with COVID-19 infection cases being rampant across the globe. Healthcare facilities are facing the heat due to sudden upsurge in patient load and infectious nature of the disease. The ability to estimate Patient’s Length of Stay (LoS) at the time of admission will help hospitals asses their capacity for further incoming patients, plan their resources and activities accordingly. Knowing the time to reach maximum servicing beforehand will equip hospitals to be ready with plan B wherein they can redirect their incoming patients to another equally capable healthcare facility. Predicting Patient’s Length of Stay (LoS) also has an overarching improved efficiency of operational tasks which helps hospitals cut down on unnecessary expenses.


Problem Statement:

In this project we are trying to predict length of stay of the patient at the time of admission. The hospitals can then optimize the treatment plan to minimize Patient’s Length of Stay (LoS) and take sufficient safety measures to reduce the chance of infections [3]. This will also help the hospitals in planning the logistics/resource allotment like rooms, beds and consumables among patients.
